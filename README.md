# OOP_project
This project was my exam for the Unimore "Programmazione a oggetti" course, carried out in January 2021.

In this repository you can find:
- "Gestore_Spedizioni" where the Java code of a shipping manager is present
- "Documentazione" which represents the documentation of the project generated with Javadoc
- "polimorfismo.txt" which indicates in which points of the program the polymorphism is present

The final grade was 30/30.
